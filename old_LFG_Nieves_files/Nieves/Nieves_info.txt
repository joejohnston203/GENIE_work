Nieves' QEL model with RPA

Nieves' model depends on the LFG nuclear model, so all files 
from that model are used.

Files that must be added/modified in the GENIE code in order
to implement Nieves QEL model:

Added:

src/LlewellynSmith/NievesQELCCPXSec.cxx
src/LlewellynSmith/NievesQELException.h
src/LlewellynSmith/NievesQELException.cxx

Modified:

config/ Messenger files
src/LwlynSmith/LinkDef.h
src/QEL/QELKinematicsGenerator.h
src/QEL/QELKinematicsGenerator.cxx
src/QEL/QELPrimaryLeptonGenerator.cxx

Files from LFGNuclearModel:
config/LocalFGM.xml
config/LwlynSmithQELCCPXSec.xml
config/QELXSec.xml
src/CrossSections/QELXSec.h
src/CrossSections/QELXSec.cxx

Summary:

config/NievesQELCCPXSec.xml:
src/LlewellynSmith/NievesQELCCPXSec.h
src/LlewellynSmith/NievesQELCCPXSec.cxx
src/LlewellynSmith/NievesQELException.h
src/LlewellynSmith/NievesQELException.cxx

Files to implement Nieves' QEL model. It can include RPA long range 
correlations in order to account for the intermediate W boson 
interacting with surrounding nucleons. It can also include
Couloumb corrections. Gives identical results 
to LwlynSmithQELCCPXSec when the target is a free nucleon. The
exception is thrown if an event is unphysical, such as when
Coulomb effects would push the event below threshold.

config/master_config.xml
One line added to link to NievesQELCCPXSec.xml
(One line added to link to LFGNuclearModel.xml)

config/UserPhysicsOptions.xml
Comments added to mention NievesQELCCPXSec (and LocalFGM)
as options

config/ Messenger files 
updated to inclue NievesQELCCPXSec (and LocalFGM)
use the same messenger settings as LwlynSmithQELCCPXSec
(and BodekRitchie)

src/LwlynSmith/LinkDef.h
Updated to link NievesQELCCPXSec to the genie

src/QEL/QELKinematicsGenerator.h
src/QEL/QELKinematicsGenerator.cxx
src/QEL/QELPrimaryLeptonGenerator.cxx
QELKinematicsGenerator generates a temporary lepton before 
calculating the cross section, and then stores that lepton
if the temporary kinematics are accepted. Also updated
to catch NievesQELCCPXSecException.
QELPrimaryLeptonGenerator accesses the stored lepton and
adds it to the event record.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
LocalFGM:
Local Fermi gas model, where the Fermi momentum depends on the position
in the nucleus. Nieves used this model when doing his calculation,
so the best data should be obtained by combining Nieves' QEL model
with the LFG nuclear model.
The code to implement Nieves' model also depends on several changes
made for the LocalFGM model, such as changes to QELXSec so that
the physics necessary to do an integral is moved to the XSec object
(in this case NievesQELCCPXSec), so I can have the Nieves code
always average over initial nucleons when calculating the integral.
See LFG_info.txt for more info about the changes added with the
LocalFGM model.
