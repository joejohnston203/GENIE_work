Nieves' QEL model with RPA

Nieves' model depends on the LFG nuclear model, so all files 
from that model are used.

Files that must be added/modified in the GENIE code in order
to implement Nieves QEL model:

Added:
config/NievesQELCCPXSec.xml
src/LlewellynSmith/NievesQELCCPXSec.h
src/LlewellynSmith/NievesQELCCPXSec.cxx
src/LlewellynSmith/NievesQELException.h
src/LlewellynSmith/NievesQELException.cxx
config/QELEventGenerator.xml
src/QEL/QELEventGenerator.cxx
src/QEL/QELEventGenerator.h

Modified:
config/master_config.xml
config/UserPhysicsOptions.xml 
config/ Messenger files
src/LlewelynSmith/LinkDef.h
config/EventGenerator.xml
src/Conventions/KinePhaseSpace.h
src/Interaction/InitialState.cxx
src/Interaction/InitialState.h
src/QEL/LinkDef.h
src/QEL/QELPrimaryLeptonGenerator.cxx
src/QEL/QELKinematicsGenerator.h
src/QEL/QELKinematicsGenerator.cxx
(Note that if the QELEventGenerator class replaces the old QEL
code in GENIE, then QELKinematicsGenerator will no longer be needed,
but the QELPrimaryLeptonGenerator class is still required because
it contains code that allows the NievesQELCCPXSec code to generate
an outgoing lepton for each Q2 when integrating over Q2 to generate
the spline)

Files from LFGNuclearModel:

Summary:

config/NievesQELCCPXSec.xml:
src/LlewellynSmith/NievesQELCCPXSec.h
src/LlewellynSmith/NievesQELCCPXSec.cxx
src/LlewellynSmith/NievesQELException.h
src/LlewellynSmith/NievesQELException.cxx

Files to implement Nieves' QEL model. It can include RPA long range 
correlations in order to account for the intermediate W boson 
interacting with surrounding nucleons. It can also include
Couloumb corrections. Gives identical results 
to LwlynSmithQELCCPXSec when the target is a free nucleon. The
exception is thrown if an event is unphysical, such as when
Coulomb effects would push the event below threshold.

config/master_config.xml
One line added to link to NievesQELCCPXSec.xml
One line added to link to QELEventGenerator.xml
(One line added to link to LFGNuclearModel.xml)

config/UserPhysicsOptions.xml
Comments added to mention NievesQELCCPXSec (and LocalFGM)
as options

config/ Messenger files 
updated to inclue NievesQELCCPXSec and QELEventGenerator (and LocalFGM)
respectively use the same messenger settings as LwlynSmithQELCCPXSec and
QELKinematicsGenerator (and BodekRitchie)

src/LwlynSmith/LinkDef.h
Updated to link NievesQELCCPXSec to the genie

src/QEL/QELKinematicsGenerator.h
src/QEL/QELKinematicsGenerator.cxx
QELKinematicsGenerator updated to catch NievesQELCCPXSecException.

src/QEL/QELPrimaryLeptonGenerator.cxx
QELPrimaryLeptonGenerator has a method that can be accessed by
NievesQELCCPXSec that genrates a lepton and stores it in the running
kinematics variables. If there is a stored lepton when QELPrimaryLeptonGenerator
runs, it accesses that stored leptona and adds it to the event record.
(Otherwise the parent PrimaryLeptonGenerator class is called to generate
a lepton).

config/EventGenerator.xml
src/Conventions/KinePhaseSpace.h
src/Interaction/InitialState.cxx
src/Interaction/InitialState.h
src/QEL/QELEventGenerator.cxx
src/QEL/QELEventGenerator.h
Replaces FermiMover, QELKinematicsGenerator, QELPrimaryLeptonGenerator,
and QELHadronicSystemGenerator in order to generate all kinematics
before calculating the cross section.
Adaptation of Andrew Furmanski's code.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
LocalFGM:
Local Fermi gas model, where the Fermi momentum depends on the position
in the nucleus. Nieves used this model when doing his calculation,
so the best data should be obtained by combining Nieves' QEL model
with the LFG nuclear model.
The code to implement Nieves' model also depends on several changes
made for the LocalFGM model, such as changes to QELXSec so that
the physics necessary to do an integral is moved to the XSec object
(in this case NievesQELCCPXSec), so I can have the Nieves code
always average over initial nucleons when calculating the integral.
See LFG_info.txt for more info about the changes added with the
LocalFGM model.
